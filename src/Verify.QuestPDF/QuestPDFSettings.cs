    /// canonicalized — rebuilds it and repairs the cross-reference table, all to change nothing.

    /// The metadata dates are already pinned to a fixed value before generation, so QuestPDF output

    /// <c>/ID</c> and any XMP packet, should a future QuestPDF or Skia version start emitting them.
    /// <para>
    /// The XMP canonicalization is worth calling out because it is the pass that changes bytes for
    /// an already-deterministic producer: it collapses the packet's whitespace, so enabling or
    /// disabling this setting on an existing suite shifts the stored <c>.verified.pdf</c> even
    /// though nothing about the document changed. Expect to re-accept those snapshots once.
